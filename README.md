gitmergepushpull
================

mergepushpull is an addon for git made to improve your workflow by removing one of the most time consuming, repeditous parts of git.  It's fast, easy to use, and free.

                      mergepushpull (accuracy)                     vanilla git (precision)

Most version management software prioritizes precision over accuracy.  But if you flip that constraint, it frees your software from costly thread locking.  mergepushpull asycronously performs all 3 operations at once.  It's blazing fast.  The interface is so snappy, you'll forget its there. 

Today is the day to cross the streams!
