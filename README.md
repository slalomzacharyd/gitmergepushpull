Most version management software prioritizes precision over accuracy.  But if you flip that constraint, it frees your software from costly thread locking.  mergepushpull asycronously performs all 3 operations at once.  It's blazing fast.  The interface is so snappy, you'll forget its there. 

Today is the day to cross the streams!
